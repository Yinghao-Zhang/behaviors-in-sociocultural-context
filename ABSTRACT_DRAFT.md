## Predictive Validation for A Computational Framework of Interpersonal Behavioral Choices in Ecological Momentary Assessment

### Background

Personality pathology often manifests through moment-to-moment behavioral choices shaped by interpersonal contexts. While these choices can be captured through ecological momentary assessment (EMA), existing analytical approaches rarely formalize the learning mechanisms through which social feedback creates affective and behavioral variances. Agent-based computational models have proven valuable in controlled experimental settings for understanding decision-making processes, but their applicability to sparse and noisy ambulatory data remains unclear. We test a situationally-sensitive agent-based computational framework using predictive validation on simulated EMA data of interpersonal behaviors, specifically, the interpersonal approach-avoidance dilemma common in personality pathology. This particular pair of behavior choices are associated with Detachment, Negative Affectivity, and Antagonism dimensions of PID-5. Our computational model integrates (1) a tripartite behavioral selection model using *habitual tendency* (behavioral automaticity), *affective valuation* (enjoyment-based outcome prediction), and *goal-based expectancy* (utility-based outcome prediction); (2) trial-by-trial learning via prediction-error updating; and (3) social influences including observational learning, suggestion incorporation, and feedback-based outcome modulation. This approach tests whether agent-based models can capture the complexity of interpersonal behavioral dynamics in ambulatory assessment contexts, providing a foundation for understanding how social contingencies shape maladaptive behaviors in personality pathology.

### Method

To test robustness across diverse parameter settings, we implemented 10 multi-agent simulation configurations systematically varying in (1) behavioral priorities (habit-dominant, affective-dominant, goal-dominant, balanced); (2) learning rates (fast: α = 0.30-0.50, slow: α = 0.03-0.12, moderate: α = 0.10-0.30); (3) social influence levels (high vs. low receptivity to suggestions and feedback from social partners); and (4) population variance (heterogeneous vs. homogeneous sample). Each simulation modeled 50 main agents interacting with ~100 social partners across four situation types derivable from sparse ambulatory data (5-25 reported events per person): (a) *observational* learning (18%)—agents observe others' choices and update habitual tendencies vicariously; (b) *solitary action* (24%)—independent choice via weighted combination of habitual tendency, affective valuation, and goal expectancy; (c) *suggestion influence* (30%)—partners provide recommendations incorporated into behavioral choices; (d) *feedback modulation* (28%)—partners' reactions based on outcome discrepancies, creating interpersonal contingencies. We validated each configuration using between-person prediction (80/20 train/test split), where parameters from training individuals predicted held-out individuals' choices, comparing full model against null, logistic regression, and a truncated computational model with no learning components. Full simulation and analysis code is available at https://github.com/Yinghao-Zhang/behaviors-in-sociocultural-context.git.

### Results

Across 10 systematically varied parameter configurations, the full model achieved mean prediction accuracy of 92.9% (AUC = 0.77) on held-out individuals, consistently outperforming no-learning (AUC = 0.65, +18.7%), logistic regression (AUC = 0.56, +38.1%), and null (AUC = 0.50, +53.8%) baselines. Learning mechanisms were essential: they improved calibration by 15.1% (log-loss reduction) and discrimination by 22.8% (AUC gain) across configurations, demonstrating that personality dynamics emerge through accumulated social experience rather than static dispositions. Critically, model performance remained robust across diverse parameter profiles: habit-dominant (AUC = 0.84), affective-dominant (AUC = 0.72), goal-dominant (AUC = 0.56), fast learners (AUC = 0.78), slow learners (AUC = 0.78), high social influence (AUC = 0.87), low social influence (AUC = 0.72), heterogeneous populations (AUC = 0.79), and homogeneous populations (AUC = 0.76). The full model outperformed the no-learning baseline in 9 of 10 configurations, with strongest learning contributions observed in habit-dominant (+37%) and baseline balanced (+38%) profiles. Superior calibration (mean log-loss = 0.23) indicates capacity to capture probabilistic behavioral choice under social uncertainty, essential for modeling within-person variability characteristic of personality pathology.

### Discussion

This work demonstrates the potential feasibility and robustness of applying agent-based computational models to ambulatory assessment data of interpersonal behaviors, moving personality pathology research from correlational descriptions toward formal specification of generative mechanisms linking social environments to behavioral dynamics. The consistent 15-23% improvement in predictive performance attributable to learning mechanisms (across 10 diverse parameter configurations) demonstrates that maladaptive patterns cannot be understood as trait expression alone but require modeling how individuals integrate social information across encounters—shifting conceptualization from stable dispositions to dynamic learning processes. Robustness across habit-dominant, affective-dominant, and goal-dominant profiles; fast and slow learners; high and low social influence contexts; and heterogeneous versus homogeneous populations validates applicability to diverse personality pathology presentations characteristic of sparse, noisy EMA data. The framework enables decomposing dysfunction into interpretable behavioral parameters: low learning from positive feedback may underlie Detachment, while high receptivity to suggestions combined with variable partner quality may characterize Vulnerable Narcissism's interpersonal chaos. Extensions can incorporate passive sensing (GPS for social vs. solitary detection), physiological markers (heart rate variability as outcome valence proxy), and natural language processing to extract suggestion content from text responses. By formalizing multilevel contexts—proximal (partner feedback dynamics) nested within distal structures (stable social network characteristics)—this validated computational framework provides a foundation for precision interventions targeting specific dysfunction sources: maladaptive value systems, impaired learning mechanisms, or exposure to invalidating environments.
