## Modeling Social Context in Behavioral Choice: A Computational Framework for Multilevel Personality Dynamics in Ambulatory Assessment

### Background

Personality pathology manifests through moment-to-moment behavioral choices shaped by interpersonal contexts, yet existing models rarely formalize the learning mechanisms through which social feedback creates the affective and behavioral instability characteristic of these disorders (Carpenter & Trull, 2013; Wright et al., 2021). While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) captures real-time dynamics, standard analyses correlate situational features with outcomes without modeling the generative processes—belief updating, social influence integration—that produce context-dependent behavior over time. We introduce a computational framework integrating (1) a tripartite cognitive model mapping to established constructs: *habit* (behavioral automaticity), *affective valuation* (enjoyment-based outcome prediction), and *goal-based expectancy* (utility-based outcome prediction); (2) trial-by-trial learning via prediction-error updating and behavioral reinforcement; and (3) multilevel social influences including observational learning, suggestion incorporation, and feedback-based outcome modulation. This framework operationalizes how proximal interpersonal contexts (partner suggestions, social feedback) interact with individual learning parameters to generate temporal dynamics observable in ambulatory data, providing a computational foundation for understanding how social contingencies amplify instability in personality pathology.

### Method

We implemented a multi-agent simulation mirroring EMA data structure: 50 main agents interacting with 100 social partners across four situation types derivable from real ambulatory data via self-report tags, passive sensing (GPS co-location), or natural language processing: (a) *observational learning* (20%)—agents observe others' choices and update habits vicariously with attenuated learning; (b) *solitary action* (25%)—independent choice using weighted combination of habit, affective valuation, and goal expectancy; (c) *suggestion influence* (37%)—partners provide recommendations incorporated proportional to receptivity; (d) *feedback modulation* (38%)—partners' reactions depend on discrepancies between agents' outcomes and partners' predictions, creating interpersonal contingencies. Agents learn via prediction-error updating (learning rates α ~ 0.10–0.30) while partners maintain fixed parameters representing stable environmental characteristics. We validated the model using between-person prediction (80/20 train/test split, 40/10 individuals), comparing population-parameter-based predictions against null, logistic regression, and no-learning baselines—providing a complementary test of generalization beyond traditional within-person model fits (Wilson & Collins, 2019). Full simulation code and validation procedures are available at [repository link].

### Results

The full model achieved 77.8% prediction accuracy on held-out individuals with superior calibration (log loss = 0.47 vs. 0.54 for null, 21% improvement; AUC = 0.70 vs. 0.59 for logistic regression). Learning mechanisms were essential: eliminating learning parameters reduced accuracy to 50.7%, demonstrating a **27% performance gain** attributable to belief updating—quantifying how personality dynamics emerge through accumulated social experience rather than static dispositions. Population parameters revealed dominance of outcome evaluations (affective weight = 0.82, goal weight = 0.89) over habit (0.47), suggesting individuals prioritize anticipated consequences over automaticity—a pattern potentially reflecting interpersonal hypervigilance in personality pathology where individuals constantly reassess social outcomes rather than relying on behavioral routines. Critically, social context systematically amplified outcome variability: feedback situations produced 23% higher utility variance (σ = 0.35) than solitary actions (σ = 0.29), computationally demonstrating how interpersonal contingency functions as a proximal mechanism for affective and behavioral instability (cf. Carpenter & Trull, 2013). This variance amplification arises because partners' reactions vary based on their own value systems—a source of unpredictability absent in solitary contexts. The model's calibration advantage was more pronounced than raw accuracy gains, indicating capacity to capture the probabilistic nature of behavioral choice under social uncertainty, crucial for modeling within-person variability in symptom expression characteristic of Cluster B disorders.

### Discussion

This work moves personality pathology research from correlational descriptions of "context matters" toward formal specification of generative mechanisms linking social environments to behavioral dynamics (Roche & Pincus, 2024). The finding that learning accounts for 27% of predictive variance demonstrates that maladaptive patterns cannot be understood as trait expression alone but require modeling how individuals integrate social information across encounters—this shifts conceptualization from stable dispositions to dynamic learning processes. The 23% variance amplification under social feedback computationally instantiates a core clinical phenomenon: individuals with personality pathology experience heightened instability specifically in relationship-dense environments because interpersonal contingencies introduce outcome unpredictability absent in solitary contexts. This framework enables decomposing dysfunction into interpretable cognitive parameters, suggesting that instability may arise from specific parameter configurations: high outcome weighting (affective/goal priorities) combined with high feedback exposure creates maximal sensitivity to partners' variable responses. Maladaptive traits can thus be reconceptualized as parameter patterns—for example, low learning from positive feedback (reduced α for positive outcomes) may underlie Detachment, while high receptivity to suggestions combined with variable partner quality may characterize Vulnerable Narcissism's interpersonal chaos. The model is immediately applicable to EMA data containing trial-level choices, self-reported outcomes, and situation classifications, with extensions incorporating passive sensing (GPS for social vs. solitary detection), physiological markers (heart rate variability as outcome valence proxy), and natural language processing of text responses to extract suggestion content (Trull & Ebner-Priemer, 2020). By formalizing multilevel contexts—proximal (partner feedback dynamics) nested within distal structures (stable social network characteristics)—this computational framework provides a foundation for precision interventions targeting specific dysfunction sources: maladaptive value systems (cognitive restructuring), impaired learning mechanisms (feedback quality enhancement), or exposure to invalidating environments (context modification).
